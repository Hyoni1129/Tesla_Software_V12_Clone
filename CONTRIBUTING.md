## Commit Message Best Practices

- Use the **imperative mood** in the summary (e.g., ‚Äúadd‚Äù, not ‚Äúadded‚Äù).
- Keep the summary under **50 characters** if possible.
- Don‚Äôt end the summary with a period (`.`).
- Use a blank line between the summary and the body if adding more detail.
- If needed, explain the *why* and *how* in the commit body.

**Example**:

feat(battery): add real-time battery widget

This widget displays the current battery percentage and estimated range. It updates every 10 seconds using the Battery Status API.

## Example Commits

feat(ui): add weather widget to dashboard fix(gps): fix inaccurate location in tunnel mode style(map): fix inconsistent padding on mobile refactor(settings): extract theme toggle into separate component docs: update README with setup instructions

By following these conventions, we keep the commit history readable and consistent‚Äîmaking it easier for everyone to collaborate and understand changes.
